## Overview

Development of a rigid and dependable database managment system for checking prices on routes.

## Key Features

- **Database Sorting**: The Logistic Company Database Manager allows users to efficiently sort the company's database. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface with powerful sorting capabilities, enabling users to search, filter, and sort through the available data effortlessly.
- **Price Comparison**: Users can input pricing criteria into the application, and it will analyze the database to identify the most cost-effective options. The application will output the cheapest available option(s) based on the given criteria, assisting the logistic company in making informed decisions.
- **WPF Interface customization**: he application's front-end is built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), a powerful framework for developing visually appealing desktop applications. WPF offers a rich set of controls and flexible layout options, ensuring an immersive and engaging user experience.
- **Efficiency and Performance**: The database manager is optimized for efficiency and performance, leveraging the capabilities of C# and the WPF framework. It efficiently handles large datasets, ensuring quick response times and a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: For dependable, rigid and versatility
- **WPF UI framework.**: For a responsive and rigid UI
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
